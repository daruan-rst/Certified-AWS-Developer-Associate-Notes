# AWS Access Keys
What are the possible ways a user can access AWS?
- To access AWS a user has three options:
    - AWS Management Console (password + MFA)
    - AWS Command Line (access key)
    - AWS Software Development Kit [for code](access key)
- AWS Access Keys are generated through the AWS Console
- Users manage their own access Keys
- Access Keys are secret like a password
    -  Access Keys ID ~= username
    - Secret Access Key ~= password
- Whenever created and loaded into the command line interface (CLI), the access keys allows a user to access the AWS API
