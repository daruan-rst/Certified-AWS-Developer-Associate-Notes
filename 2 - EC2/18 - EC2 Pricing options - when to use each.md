# EC2 Pricing Options: When to Use Each



### On-Demand Instances

- **Appropriate for:** Sudden, unpredictable usage patterns or temporary tasks.
- **Examples:** Initial testing, ad hoc analysis, or disaster recovery fallback.
- **Selection Criteria:** No long-term commitments; required when flexibility and speed are prioritized over cost.

---

### Reserved Instances & Savings Plans

- **Appropriate for:** Long-lived applications with predictable usage.
- **Examples:** Backend APIs, internal business apps, or fixed traffic databases.
- **Selection Criteria:** Best suited when usage is consistent over time and cost predictability is critical. Convertible options are preferable when future needs may shift.

---

### Spot Instances

- **Appropriate for:** Workloads tolerant to interruptions and optimized for cost-efficiency.
- **Examples:** Batch processing, containerized tasks, machine learning model training.
- **Selection Criteria:** Ideal for applications that can be paused or distributed without data loss. Should not be used where availability is essential.

---

### Dedicated Hosts

- **Appropriate for:** Workloads bound by licensing or compliance that require visibility into the physical host.
- **Examples:** Enterprise applications with per-core licensing, or systems under audit.
- **Selection Criteria:** Used when tenancy control and hardware-level transparency are needed for security or compliance.

---

### Dedicated Instances

- **Appropriate for:** Isolation at the physical level without the need for full host control.
- **Examples:** Use cases with basic isolation requirements without strict licensing needs.
- **Selection Criteria:** Useful when hardware sharing with external customers is not acceptable, but full host visibility is unnecessary.

---

### Capacity Reservations

- **Appropriate for:** Time-sensitive or event-driven operations requiring capacity guarantees in specific zones.
- **Examples:** Planned product launches, failover zones in disaster recovery plans.
- **Selection Criteria:** Best used when availability matters more than cost savings. Often used in combination with Reserved Instances or Savings Plans.
